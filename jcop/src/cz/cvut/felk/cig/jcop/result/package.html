Result contains all information about run of a solver.

Every result contains entries, which are something like elementary results. Entry holds information about one algorithm
being applied on one problem - best solution found, time spend, optimize counter and possibly some extra info.

Result can contain multiple entries for the same problem or algorithm, entries are not required to be unique at all.

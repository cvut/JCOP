Basic implementation of genetic algorithm.

Starts with random population (with given size) and in every iteration creates new population from previous one.
Individuals to become parents are randomly selected from population based on their fitness such that higher fitness
means higher chance of became parent. Two parents produces two children, which could be possibly mutated. Repeating this
creates new population.

Package consists of interfaces to add own Mutation, Reproduction and Selection. Default implementations are
SimpleMutation, OnePointCrossoverReproduction and TournamentSelection (respectively).
